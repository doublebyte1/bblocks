# Feature (Schema)

*Version 1.0*

A feature. Every feature is a sub-resource of an OGC Collection.

[*Maturity*](https://github.com/cportele/ogcapi-building-blocks#building-block-maturity): Mature

## Description

A feature is an abstraction of real world phenomena [ISO 19101-1:2014].

The GeoJSON representation is the currently recommended representation that all APIs should support, where GeoJSON can
be used for the data.

Each GeoJSON feature includes the following JSON members:

* `type`: fixed value "Feature".
* `geometry`: the primary geometry of the feature describing its location as a GeoJSON geometry object. `null`, if the
  feature has no spatial geometry.
* `properties`: an object with a member for each feature property.
