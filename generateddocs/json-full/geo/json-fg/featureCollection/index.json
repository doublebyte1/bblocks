Additional information is mainly encoded in\nadditional top-level members of GeoJSON objects. The members use keys that do not conflict with GeoJSON including the\nobsolete version that pre-dates the IETF standard. GeoJSON clients will be able to parse and understand all aspects that\nare specified by GeoJSON, JSON-FG clients will also parse and understand the additional capabilities.\n\nThis Standard specifies the following minimal extensions to the GeoJSON Standard:\n\n* The ability to use Coordinate Reference Systems (CRSs) other than WGS 84;\n* The ability to use non-Euclidean metrics, in particular ellipsoidal metrics;\n* Support for solids and prisms as geometry types;\n* The ability to encode temporal characteristics of a feature; and\n* The ability to declare the type and the schema of a feature.\n\nInformation that can be represented as GeoJSON is encoded as GeoJSON.
