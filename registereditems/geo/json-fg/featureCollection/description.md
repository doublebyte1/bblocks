OGC Features and Geometries JSON (JSON-FG) extends GeoJSON to support a limited set of additional capabilities that are
out-of-scope for GeoJSON, but that are essential or important for a variety of use cases involving feature data.

A **feature collection** contains a set of features from a dataset.

This building block represents a schema for collections of features using the FG-JSON schema.
