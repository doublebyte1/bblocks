  "abstract": "The distribution of a geospatial dataset in an API is organized into one or more collections of data. How the data is split into collections in a distribution depends on the intended use of the data. Two common approaches for organizing the data are: by semantic type and by spatial clustering. The OGC Collections JSON resource provides information about and access to the data in each collection of the distribution.",
