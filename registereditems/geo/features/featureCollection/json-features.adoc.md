# Overview

The features in an [OGC Collection](../common/json-collection.adoc).

This resource supports spatial filtering with the [`bbox`
parameter](../../common/parameters/bbox.adoc), temporal filtering with
the [`datetime` parameter](../common/parameters-datetime.adoc).

To avoid overloading clients and servers, both clients and servers can
limit the maximum number of features in a representation of the
resource. In this case, paging is supported to provide access to all the
features in the collection that match the specified filter conditions.

Properties

# Link relation types

The following link relation types are commonly used in links from a
Features resource:

| Link relation type | Description                                                                                                                                  |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `self`             | **REQUIRED**. Link to the resource in the current representation.                                                                            |
| `alternate`        | **REQUIRED**. Link to the resource in every other media type supported by the server.                                                        |
| `next`             | **CONDITIONAL**. If the response is a page of a paged response and there is another page, a link will reference that next page.              |
| `prev`             | If the response is a page of a paged response and there is a previous page, a link may reference that previous page.                         |
| `first`            | If the response is a page of a paged response, a link may reference the first page.                                                          |
| `last`             | If the response is a page of a paged response, a link may reference the last page.                                                           |
| `license`          | **RECOMMENDED**. Refers to the license associated with the data.                                                                             |
| `describedby`      | Refers to a resource providing information about the data, for example, a schema for the feature collection or a separate metadata resource. |

Outgoing link relation types

The following link relation types are commonly used in links to a
Features resource:

<table>
<caption>Incoming link relation types</caption>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 25%" />
<col style="width: 75%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Link relation type</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p><code>items</code></p></td>
<td><p>From a <a href="../common/json-collection.adoc">OGC Collection resource</a>.</p>
<p>This link relation type will not be registered with IANA. In the future, it may be superseded by the <code>search</code> link relation type.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p><code>search</code></p></td>
<td><p>From any resource that wants to link to a resource that supports searching the features, e.g. from a <a href="../../common/resources/collection.adoc">OGC Collection resource</a>.</p>
<p>This link relation type is expected to supersede the use of the <code>items</code> link relation type.</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

# Representation: GeoJSON

The GeoJSON representation is the currently recommended representation
that all APIs should support, where GeoJSON can be used for the data.

In addition to the pre-defined properties listed above, each GeoJSON
feature collection includes a JSON member with the key `type` and the
value "FeatureCollection".

# Representation: HTML

Providing an HTML representation is recommended so that the resource can
be displayed in a web browser and indexed by search engines.

The HTML representation should include all information that is part of
the JSON representation.
