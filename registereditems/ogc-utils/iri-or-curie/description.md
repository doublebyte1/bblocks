A Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) is defined in [RFC3986](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3986.txt) as a
sequence of characters chosen from a limited subset of the repertoire
of US-ASCII ASCII characters.

A CURIE ("Compact URI") is a data type whose purpose is specifically to allow for the definition
of scoped names that map to URIs.

The "IRI-or-CURIE" building block defines a data type representing either an IRI or a CURIE (with or without a prefix).
